		    <h3>Input Device</h3>
            <img src="input device.jpg" alt="input" class="center" width= "200px">
		    <p>In computing, an input device is a piece of equipment used to provide data and control signals to an information processing system such as a computer or information appliance. Examples of input devices include keyboards, mouse, scanners, cameras, joysticks, and microphones.</p>

			<h3>Output Device</h3>
            <img src="input device.jpg" alt="input" class="center" width= "200px">		
			<p>An output device is any piece of computer hardware equipment which converts information into human readable form. It can be text, graphics, tactile, audio, and video. Some of the output devices are Visual Display Units (VDU) i.e. a Monitor, Printer graphic Output devices, Plotters, Speakers etc.</p>

		    <h3>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h3>
            <img src="input device.jpg" alt="input" class="center" width= "200px">
			<p>A central processing unit (CPU), also called a central processor, main processor or just processor, is the electronic circuitry that executes instructions comprising a computer program</p>

		    <h3>Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)</h3>
            <img src="input device.jpg" alt="input" class="center" width= "200px">
		    <p>In computing, an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a combinational digital circuit that performs arithmetic and bitwise operations on integer binary numbers.</p>

			<h3>Control Unit</h3>
            <img src="input device.jpg" alt="input" class="center" width= "200px">
			<p>The control unit (CU) is a component of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) that directs the operation of the processor. It tells the computer's memory, arithmetic logic unit and input and output devices how to respond to the instructions that have been sent to the processor.</p>

		    <h3>Random Access Memory</h3>
            <img src="input device.jpg" alt="input" class="center" width= "200px">
		    <p>Random-access memory (RAM; /r√¶m/) is a form of computer memory that can be read and changed in any order, typically used to store working data and machine code.</p>

			<h3>Optical Memory</h3>
            <img src="input device.jpg" alt="input" class="center" width= "200px">
			<p>Optical storage is any storage type in which data is written and read with a laser. Typically, data is written to optical media, such as compact discs (CDs) and DVDs.</p>

			<h3>Magnetic Memory</h3>
            <img src="input device.jpg" alt="input" class="center" width= "200px">
			<p>Magnetic-core memory was the predominant form of random-access computer memory for 20 years between about 1955 and 1975. Such memory is often just called core memory, or, informally, core.</p>

			<h3>Flash Memory</h3>
            <img src="input device.jpg" alt="input" class="center" width= "200px">
			<p>Flash memory, also known as flash storage, is a type of nonvolatile memory that erases data in units called blocks and rewrites data at the byte level. Flash memory is widely used for storage and data transfer in consumer devices, enterprise systems and industrial applications.</p>

			<h3>Logic Gates</h3>
            <img src="input device.jpg" alt="input" class="center" width= "200px">
			<p>Logic gates are the basic building blocks of any digital system. It is an electronic circuit having one or more than one input and only one output. The relationship between the input and the output is based on a certain logic. Based on this, logic gates are named as AND gate, OR gate, NOT gate etc.</p>
